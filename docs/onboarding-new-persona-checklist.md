# Onboarding Checklist for New OctoAcme Personas/Roles

Use this checklist whenever a new persona/role (e.g., Technical Lead, Designer, Support Liaison) is added to a project. Helps ensure fast and comprehensive onboarding, clear ownership, and smooth handoff.

- [ ] Role added to docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md, with summary, responsibilities, and communication patterns
- [ ] Announce new role and introduce to existing team (meeting or async, as appropriate)
- [ ] Schedule intro 1:1s between new persona and each core role: PM, PdM, Lead Developer, QA, etc.
- [ ] Grant permissions to relevant tools, boards, and documentation
- [ ] Review current active project documentation: current plan, backlog, risk register, open PRs/issues
- [ ] Walk through process/cadence docs, risk and communication escalation
- [ ] Assign first set of tasks aligned with role’s strengths
- [ ] Set expectations for regular check-ins and feedback

_Repeat/modify as needed for future onboarding cycles, and add improvements based on retrospectives._
